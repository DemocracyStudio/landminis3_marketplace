Real estate is the oldest and the most popular investment around the world. With a projected growth of $4,000+ Billion by 2025*, the market for land and property sales works with an outdated system of paper record storage and offline transactions. Nowadays, transacting properties still takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money. Consequently, only 1% of the existing real estate is available on the stock market, and most of it (93%) is reserved for accredited investors (~4% of the American population**).

NFTs democratize digital ownership (art, in-game items, vouchers…), and could do much more when representing a real-world value. Real-world asset NFTs have the potential to bridge the virtual economy and the physical world. A token that denotes virtual ownership of a physical good: gold, diamond, cars, or wine collection… will be less volatile than purely digital data, it can offer passive income from rental or traditional ownership models, and its value will be supported by a concrete floor price. Furthermore, it will benefit from warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability of real-world assets while innovating in trading. Tokenizing real estate by minting properties’ ownership titles could be the foundation of a globally distributed economy, with a fair cross-border tax system supported by trustworthy data registries on housing worldwide. It will be faster, cheaper, and easier to buy & sell real estate from readily accessible transaction ledgers. And the fractional ownership of tokenized real estate will make properties even more liquid and affordable, lowering the barrier to profitable investments, and democratizing access to capital.

While tech-savvy millennials will be 70% of the global workforce by 2025, real estate ownership is quickly slipping away for too many of them. As a solution, the LandMinis3 is creating a new way to invest in real estate: by building a global community of enthusiasts as the greatest real estate club reimagining the rental business. A community, driven to reach financial freedom and wealth through real estate & crypto, applying proven investment strategies.
